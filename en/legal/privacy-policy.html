Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security at all times. Our systems and the communications networks through which you access our services may be subject to security breaches and failures which are due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</p><p><strong>RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Subject to applicable laws and regulations (including as set out under the “Sharing of your Personal Information” section above), we will only retain your Personal Information for so long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes as set out under the “How We Use Your Information” section above.</p><p>Subject to applicable laws and regulations, you may have the right to request to receive a copy of and make any corrections to your Personal Information which we hold, or to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that is stored by us.

In some instances, we may not be able to delete your Personal Information and/or Shared Information from our services or systems – in which case we will (where reasonably practicable) let you know why we are unable to do so.</p></div></div></div></div></article></div><footer class="footer section"><div class="container footer w-container"><div class="footer-item footer-item-left"> <img class="footer-logo" src="/assets/images/footer-logo-en.svg" /><div class="footer-text"><p>&copy; <span>GONGYIXING</span> 2020</p></div></div><div class="footer-item footer-item-center"></div><div class="footer-item footer-item-right icons legal-links"> <a class="link-block legal-link" href="/en/legal/statement" target="_self">Statement</a> <a class="link-block legal-link" href="/en/legal/privacy-policy" target="_self">Privacy</a> <a class="link-block legal-link" href="/en/legal/terms" target="_self">Terms</a> <a class="link-block legal-link" href="/en/trademarks/" target="_self">Trademarks</a></div></div><div class="container sitecert w-container"><p class="gyx-beihan default"> <a href="https://beian.miit.gov.cn/" class="icp">京ICP备2020035490号</a> <span class="huanhang wa"></span></p></div></footer><div class="cookie-pop"><div class="pop active"><div class="title">YOUR COOKIE PREFERENCES</div><div class="content"><p class="label">Welcome to GONGYIXING!</p><p class="desc">We would like to use analytics cookies and other similar tracking technologies (“Cookies”) to help us improve our website.
